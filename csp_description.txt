To completely define the CSP problem the following must be specified:

- Variables: Our variables are the weekly courses, for which a time slot and a room must be assigned. Our variables are represented by a tuple (c, k, i), where c is the course, k is the kind of class and i the index for that same course and kind on that week.

- Domains: Initially, the domain for each variable is composed by all the possible time slots and room combinations. The available time slots and rooms are received as an input of the program.

- Constraints: As for the constraints, we must verify 4 conditions: 
	1- if two courses are at the same time, the rooms must be different
        2- the same class cannot have two courses at the same time
        3- the same course cannot have two of ocurrences of the same kind on the same day
        4- for the same course, the lower index must come earlier in the week the greater index
